    <h1>chapter 1</h1>
    <p>
        This article will show you how to, 
        fetch test cases directly from the browser without copy-pasting and run them in VSCode with just 2 clicks, 
        create your own Snippets, and use the powerful Debugger.
        If you have been solving problems on platforms like GeeksforGeeks, CodeChef, 
        and various other judges, you are probably using an online compiler to solve problems. 
        In that case, copying, modifying, and running test cases becomes laborious. You need to switch tabs to copy-paste test cases and modify them. Solving problems is already challenging.
